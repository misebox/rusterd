# Rendering Issues

- [ ] Self-referential edges not rendered (start point = end point)
- [ ] Duplicate edges between same entity pair overlap
- [ ] Edges pass through unrelated entities
- [ ] Cardinality labels overlap when multiple edges share origin
- [ ] Some relationship labels missing (e.g., "parents" in 07_all_cardinalities)
