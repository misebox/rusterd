# Rendering Issues

- [x] Self-referential edges not rendered (start point = end point)
- [x] Duplicate edges between same entity pair overlap
- [x] Some relationship labels missing (e.g., "parents" in 07_all_cardinalities)
- [x] Cardinality labels overlap when multiple edges share origin
- [ ] Edges pass through unrelated entities
- [ ] Edge labels may overlap with entity content when placed near nodes
